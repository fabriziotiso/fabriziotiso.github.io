      <h2>The story behind it</h2>
      <p><strong>Fabrizio. </strong>Growing up, my family spent a lot of time in Portovenere, one of the most beatiful villages in Liguria, Italy. We'd go almost every weekend in the summer, docking the boat overnight in the little harbor, strolling through the little streets, enjoying the breaktaking sunset in the Golfo dei Poeti. But the dinner was the best part of it all, always at the same place - Iseo - and always with the Spaghetti alla Giuseppe, by far the best  sea-food first course ever made. Spaghetti alla Fabrizio is my humble attempt to recreate that magical dish, one that brings back some of the best memories of my childhood. I tried to make it in tens of different ways, using fregula, with or without the branzino (which is not used in Iseo's original one), fresh or canned tomatoes... This is the recipe I settled on over the years, and it brings me to tears every time I make it, thinking back on Iseo and the plate of pasta I'd been waiting for all week.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Tatiana. </strong>One of the first times Fabrizio cooked for me, he was in the kitchen very seriously and silently cooking for the better part of the evening. I sat patiently at the dinner table and gave a few failed attempts at chatting him up in the kitchen with a glass of chilled wine in hand. Finally the big reveal... a delicious seafood dinner! It took me months and maybe years to fully understand his pure passion for the craft of cooking. There have been far too many dishes to count, from old Italian receipes to intricate French dishes that are impossibly decadent, but there is nothing, and I mean nothing, like the joy and satificastion that is on Fabrizio's face after he has perfectly placed a plate of Spaghetti alla Fabrizio in front of a loved ones place mat. It's dishes like this that have continued to ignite his curiousity in the kitchen and warmed all of our souls over the years.</p>

        <h3><strong>Process:</strong></h3>
        <ol class="numbers">
          <li>Add to a large pot 2 tbsp of olive oil, four smashed garlic cloves, and 1 tbsp of minced parsley; let cook until garlic start browning. Add the mussels, clams, 1/3 cup of white wine, cover the pot and let cook for 3-4 minutes, until all the shellfish open. Transfer everything into a bowl, discarding any unopened shells and the garlic. Separate the mussels and clams from the shells and set aside; try to avoid losing any of the liquid inside the shells. Strain the cooking liquid and set aside.</li>
          <li>Add to a large pan 2 tbsp of olive oil, one smashed garlic clove, and 1 tbsp of minced parsley. Let cook until garlic start browning on low heat. Add the squid cut in little strings, cook for 4-5 minutes, then add a 1-2 tbps of the shellfish liquid (keep at least 2/3 of the total aside for later steps), cook for 2-3 more minutes. Remove from the fire, remove the garlic, and set aside.</li>
          <li>Add to a large pan 2 tbsp of olive oil, two finely chopped garlic clove, 1 tbsp of minced parsley, and one tbsp of anchovy paste. Let cook for a couple minutes on low heat and add the tomatoes. Cook for five minutes, then add 1/3 of the shellfish liquid you set aside, adjust with salt and pepper and cook for another 10-15 minutes until the liquid has reduced. Add the squid, and cook for a few more minutes, the sauce should not dry up (you can always add an extra tbsp of shellfish liquid if needed.</li>
          <li>In a pan, bring 3 tbsp of water of a boil, add the branzino filets skin down for a few seconds; this should not cook the meat, but allow you to take the skin off. Wash the pan, and add 1 tbps of olive oil, and the branzino meat cut in pieces. Cook for a couple minutes, add 4 tbsps of the tomato sauce, and stir for a couple more minutes until the meat is white and cooked through. Set aside. </li>
          <li>In a large sauce pan, cook the spaghetti in salted water. Drain after ~2/3 of the time suggested on the spaghetti packaging, but no less than four minutes less than the total suggested. Add to a large pan 2 tbsp of olive oil, one finely chopped garlic clove, and 1 tbsp of minced parsley; cook for a couple minutes and add the spaghetti; stir for a minute, add the remaining shellfish liquid, cook for a couple more minutes, and add in tomato sauce, branzino, and shellfish and cook one more minute. Add one last tbsp of minced parsley, one tbsp of olive oil, and serve.</li>
